    description:
      'Intel i960 (or 80960) was a RISC-based microprocessor design that became popular during the early 1990s as an embedded microcontroller. It became a best-selling CPU in that segment, along with the competing AMD 29000.[2] In spite of its success, Intel stopped marketing the i960 in the late 1990s, as a result of a settlement with DEC whereby Intel received the rights to produce the StrongARM CPU. The processor continues to be used for a few military applications.',

    description:
      'The MCP37D11-80 is a 12-bit pipelined A/D converter with a maximum sampling rate of 80 Msps. The high accuracy of 70.9 dB Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and over 92.2 dB Spurious Free Dynamic Range (SFDR) enable high precision measurements of fast input signals. The device operates at very low power consumption of 311 mW at 80 Msps including LVDS digital I/O. Lower power saving modes are available at 79 mW for Standby and 22 mW for Shutdown. The MCP37D11-80 includes many digital processing features that simplify system design, cost and power usage. These include an integrated digital down-converter with onboard NCO, decimation filters for improved SNR, a noise-shaping requantizer for SNR improvement around a bandwidth of interest, individual phase, offset and gain adjustment and a fractional delay recovery for time-delay corrections in multi-channel modes. Data is available through the serial DDR LVDS or parallel CMOS interface and configured via SPI. The device is available in the TFBGA-121 is qualified for automotive applications (AEC-Q100).',
